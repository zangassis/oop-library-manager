# LibraryManager 📚

**This project contains a sample ASP.NET Core app. This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).**

## Overview 📖

LibraryManager is a simple application built using ASP.NET Core minimal API in .NET 7 that demonstrates the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm and utilizes a JSON file as a database.
This application allows you to manage a library's collection of books.
